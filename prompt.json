    "category": "Most Technically Impressive",
    "tagline": "A world that learns gravity — not one that knows it.",
    "summary": "An interactive 3D sandbox where particles don’t know physics — they learn it. Each object begins uncertain about constants like gravity, mass, and friction. Through Bayesian inference and Kalman filtering, the simulation continuously updates these beliefs as the universe evolves. The entire world learns the laws of motion in real time, visualized as glowing, uncertain particles in a black minimalist cosmos.",
    "problem_statement": "Most physics engines hardcode the laws of motion — acceleration, gravity, friction — as fixed constants. Real intelligent systems, however, infer these laws from experience and uncertainty. This project reimagines physics simulation as a learning process. The goal is to build a universe that starts ignorant of its own rules and gradually discovers them through probabilistic reasoning.",
    "concept": {
      "core_idea": "Each particle maintains probabilistic beliefs about physical constants. As it moves, it observes its own motion and updates its belief distributions using Bayesian inference. Over time, these distributions converge toward the true constants — producing a visible reduction in uncertainty. The simulation thus mirrors the scientific process itself: experimentation, observation, and inference.",
      "visual_idea": "At the start, motion is chaotic and blurry — high uncertainty. As the simulation learns, uncertainty fades, and particles move smoothly. Glow intensity and motion blur represent belief variance."

      "overview": "The system fuses Newtonian mechanics with Bayesian updating, treating unknown constants as random variables whose posteriors evolve over time.",

        "definition": "P(θ|D) ∝ P(D|θ) P(θ)",
        "explanation": "Given a new observation D (position or velocity change), the system updates its belief in θ = {g, m, μ}. The likelihood P(D|θ) measures how well a given parameter set predicts observed motion. The prior P(θ) represents the object’s current beliefs, and the product defines the posterior distribution P(θ|D).",
